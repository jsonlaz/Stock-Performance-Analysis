# Stock Performance Analysis

This project uses Python and Tableau to analyze and visualize tech stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA) data.

## Data

The `data/` directory contains the following CSV files:

* `stock_data.csv`: Raw stock data from Yahoo Finance.
* `daily_returns.csv`: Daily percentage changes in stock prices.
* `cumulative_returns.csv`: Cumulative returns over time.
* `volatility.csv`: Rolling annualized volatility.

## Code

The `src/` directory contains the Python Jupyter notebook `Tech Stock Analysis.ipynb`, which performs the data analysis and calculations.

## Visualizations

The Tableau visualizations are available on Tableau Public:

* [Dashboard 1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.lazarus/viz/StockMarketTrends_17402629786650/Dashboard1)
* [Dashboard 2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.lazarus/viz/StockMarketTrends_17402629786650/Dashboard2)
